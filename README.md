# Robotics WebApp
Better name pending
## Purpose
This application will be built to help FIRST robotics team scout during matches and competitions easier and more efficiently. It is definitly a work in progress and will be for some time if my aspirations are to be followed through on. I plan to build a webapp with similar functionality as https://github.com/SUPERCILEX/Robot-Scouter but then take it a step further with generating rankings based on data and limit data to each team.
## Roadmap
The guesstimated roadmap for features will be in the general order as below, this may change any time
1. User Management
2. Scouting Template Creation
3. Scouting Template Use
4. Data export
5. Data sharing (Team to team, user to user)
6. Data Visualization
7. Ranking generation
## Technology used
Expected stack (WIP)
- SQL
- ASP.NET CORE
- React
